# PriorityEmailNotifier
Aakanksha Raika, Thomas Nunno, &amp; Kyle Zeller Priority Email Notifier The priority email notifier allows the user to set the priority of any email messages by levels of importance (red, yellow, green). This later on determines both the size of the email notification that the application will provide to the user and the color of the background in the message. It is important that the user is able to easily change the configure the priority settings of the messages at any time. We also want to allow the user to easily enable and disable these pop-up notifications and to cancel the notifications as they appear.
